To run this code, you can copy and paste it into a JavaScript editor or development environment, such as the JavaScript console in a web browser like Google Chrome. Then, you can call the startGame() function to start the game.

For example, you can open the JavaScript console in Google Chrome by pressing Ctrl + Shift + J (on Windows) or Command + Option + J (on Mac), then paste the code into the console and press Enter. Then, you can call the startGame() function by typing startGame() into the console and pressing Enter. This will start the game and the game's instructions will be displayed in the console.

Alternatively, you can save the code as a JavaScript file, such as game.js, and run it in a JavaScript runtime environment, such as Node.js. To do this, you can install Node.js, open a command prompt or terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved the game.js file, and run the command node game.js to start the game.
